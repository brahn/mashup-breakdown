    <%= link_to "All Day", "http://illegal-art.net/allday/", :target => "_blank" %>
    is the 5th album by the spectacular <%= link_to "Girl Talk",
    "http://www.facebook.com/girltalkmusic", :target => "_blank" %>, composed
    from samples of <%= link_to "372 songs",
    "http://illegal-art.net/allday/samples.html", :target => "_blank" %> by other artists.
    This visual breakdown is an attempt to give a sense of
    what's going on.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've gathered the information about the timing of the samples from
    <%= link_to "Wikipedia",
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Day#Track_listing_and_samples_used", :target => "_blank"
    %> and from <%= link_to "AllDaySamples",
    "http://alldaysamples.com", :target => "_blank" %>.  They disagree quite a bit, and you
    can switch between the two.  As of this writing, Wikipedia only has
    start times, not end times, so I've treated all samples as if they are
    30 seconds long.
